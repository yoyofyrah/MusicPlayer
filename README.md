# MusicPlayer
Basic music player for showcasing compositional skills that I wrote for programming practie and to put on my itch.io page as a portfolio piece to show I can write music competently. 

Feel free to use for any project if you need to. You can replace the preload with any file you drop into your music folder in the project.

Also, enjoy the music if you like :)
